# Mapping Earthquakes

## Objective
* This project is to utilize Javascript, CSS, HTML, and Leaflet to map the world's earthquake data (GeoJSON).

## Results
* The map contains various layers to achieve different viewing options for the user.
* The map shows all earthquakes with the circle size showing the magnitude of the quake.
* One of the layers shows the major earthquakes. Major is a magnitude greater than 4.5.
* Clicking on the circles also provides more information about the earthquake.

## Legends
* Two legends are shown on the map. One shows all earthquakes and the other shows just earthquakes over 4.5 in magnitude.
* The legends also include color variation depending on magnitude of the earthquake.
